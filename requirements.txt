1. Need 3 end points for authentication.(JWT)
    /auth  token expirty time 15min 
    /refresh token expiry time 6hr 
    /register for registring new user 

    with the help of refresh token we will be updating the auth token when expired. 

2. Need to have google authentication in the sign in 
3. navigate to user form - http://localhost:3000/inputform 
    user can enter all the details and should save in the datebase (consider email id has the unique key to track the records)

4. Images we upload in input form should be  minimized to best size without loosing clarity. 
5. navigte to http://localhost:3000/payment  for payment changes. Add api calls for these too.
